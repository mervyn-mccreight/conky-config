# Conky configuration
## Description
This shows my conky configueation. 
It is split in three different parts: 
The files `conky.conf` and `activity.conf` contain the configuration for informational sidebars and `calendar.conf` contains the configuration to view a clock with a formatted calendar (thanks to [Seth Just](https://homepage.sethjust.com/) for highlighting how to obtain a calendar with current date highlighting in conky just using cal and sed, which are standard tools), highlighting the current date.

## How to use
Just start three conky processes - one for each configuration. The configuration is optimized for a resolution of `1366x768 px`.

## Example
